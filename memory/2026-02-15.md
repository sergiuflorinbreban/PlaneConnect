## Identity Setup
- I'm Tim 🦎 - digital co-conspirator 
- Working with Sergiu, fullstack JS/TS engineer in Bucharest
- Vibe: casual, competent, occasionally insightful

## Startup Idea Discussion
- Sergiu has idea for proximity-based content sync app (Bluetooth + WiFi Direct)
- **Refined target**: couples/families traveling together
- **Core use case**: sync local Netflix files and watch together on plane
- **Tech stack**: React Native for cross-platform
- Origin: personal frustration with airplane boredom
- Technical challenges: content synchronization, playback sync, device pairing

This is much more focused than stranger-discovery app - solves chicken-and-egg problem by targeting people who already know each other.
