## PlaneConnect Project

Started building a React Native app for airplane passenger connectivity with Bluetooth LE.

### Project Setup
- Created React Native project in `/Users/brbclawd/.openclaw/workspace/PlaneConnect`
- Using React Native 0.76.5 with TypeScript
- Installed dependencies: react-native-ble-manager, react-native-webrtc, @react-navigation/*

### Key Features Implemented
1. **BLE Manager** - Scan for nearby devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (works with airplane mode)
2. **Advertise Mode** - Make device discoverable to other passengers
3. **Device Connection** - Connect to discovered devices
4. **Navigation** - Stack navigation with Home, Scan, Advertise, DeviceDetail screens

### iOS Configuration
- Updated `ios/PlaneConnect/Info.plist` with Bluetooth permissions
- Created `ios/Podfile` with React Native pods
- Requires: `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription`, `NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription`

### Current Status
✅ Project structure created
✅ BLE manager integrated
✅ UI screens created
✅ iOS configuration files created
✅ Pod install completed (81 dependencies, 81 pods)
⏳ Testing on physical iOS device needed (Xcode required)

### Xcode Setup
- Xcode project created at: `ios/PlaneConnect.xcworkspace`
- Requires Xcode 14+ to build and run
- Use `npx expo run:ios` or open in Xcode

### Pod Install Fix
- Homebrew Ruby had encoding issues (`Unicode Normalization not appropriate for ASCII-8BIT`)
- Fixed by setting locale: `export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 && export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`
- Pod install completed successfully with 81 dependencies and 81 pods

### To Build and Run:
```bash
# Using Expo
cd PlaneConnect
npx expo run:ios

# Or open in Xcode
open ios/PlaneConnect.xcworkspace
```

### Technical Notes
- BLE works with airplane mode enabled on iOS/Android
- react-native-ble-manager used for Bluetooth functionality
- WebRTC ready for future video streaming
- Project location: `/Users/brbclawd/.openclaw/workspace/PlaneConnect`

## Late Session Updates (2026-02-17)

### GitHub Repository
- Created private GitHub repo: https://github.com/sergiuflorinbreban/PlaneConnect
- Pushed initial code with BLE scanning/advertising functionality
- Fixed package.json - removed non-existent `@react-native/metro-preset` dependency

### New Features Added (Targeting Airline Pain Points)

#### Pain Points Addressed:
1. **Expensive/Unreliable In-Flight WiFi** - PlaneConnect works offline via BLE
2. **No Content Synchronization** - Everyone watching same thing, synced playback
3. **No Offline Content Sharing** - Share photos/videos/music without internet
4. **Audio Over Earpiece** - BLE audio streaming to multiple devices
5. **No Collaboration** - Group chat with emoji reactions

#### New Features:
- **🎬 Watch Together** - Synchronized video playback with status indicators
- **📂 Share Files** - Offline file sharing (photos, videos, music)
- **💬 Chat & Reactions** - Group chat with emoji buttons (no typing needed)

#### BLE Service UUIDs:
- SERVICE_UUID: `12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef0`
- DATA_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID: `12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef1`
- CONTROL_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID: `12345678-1234-5678-1234-56789abcdef2`

#### Features in App.tsx:
- **HomeScreen** - Feature cards for new capabilities, quick actions, info
- **ScanScreen** - BLE device discovery with signal strength (RSSI)
- **AdvertiseScreen** - Toggle advertising on/off (works with airplane mode)
- **DeviceDetailScreen** - Connect to devices with action buttons
- **SyncPlayerScreen** - Video player with sync status to connected device
- **FileShareScreen** - File list with send buttons for sharing
- **GroupChatScreen** - Chat with emoji buttons for quick reactions

#### Technical Improvements:
- Added `TextInput` import for chat functionality
- Implemented playback simulation with useEffect interval
- Progress bar shows current playback position
- All screens have proper navigation back buttons

### Xcode Issue
- Machine lacks Xcode installation
- Only command line tools available (`/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`)
- Need Xcode from Mac App Store to build iOS apps
- Pods already installed successfully - only Xcode missing

### Next Steps:
1. Push code to GitHub (✅ done)
2. Install Xcode or use remote machine with Xcode
3. Test BLE functionality on physical device
4. Implement WebRTC for video streaming over WiFi Direct
5. Add real BLE data transmission for sync/chat

### Commands Used:
```bash
# Git setup
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit: PlaneConnect React Native app"
git remote add origin https://github.com/sergiubreban/PlaneConnect.git
git push -u origin main

# Pod install (locale fix)
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 && export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
cd ios && pod install
```
